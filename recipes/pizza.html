    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Type 00 flour</li>
        <li>Fresh or active dry years</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil Leaves</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Optional Toppics (garlic, oregano, pepperoni)</li>
    </ul><hr><br>

            Prepare the Dough:
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
                <li>In a separate container, dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water.</li>
                <li>Slowly pour the yeast and water mixture into the flour while mixing. Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic. It should be slightly sticky but not wet.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into smaller portions and shape them into balls.</li>
                <li>Place the dough balls on a floured surface, cover them with a damp cloth, and let them rise for several hours at room temperature.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
    
        <li>
            Prepare the Pizza Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>If you're using canned San Marzano tomatoes, simply crush them by hand and season with a pinch of salt. You can add a touch of olive oil for extra flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
    
        <li>
            Heat the Oven:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach, typically around 500-550°F (260-290°C). Ensure the pizza stone or steel is inside while preheating.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
    
        <li>
            Shape the Pizza:
            <ul>
                <li>On a floured surface, gently flatten a dough ball with your hands, leaving a thicker border around the edge to form the characteristic Neapolitan crust.</li>
                <li>Use your fingers to push the dough outward while rotating it, creating a thin center.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
    
        <li>
            Add Toppings:
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a small amount of the tomato sauce over the dough.</li>
                <li>Tear fresh mozzarella into small pieces and distribute them on the pizza.</li>
                <li>Add fresh basil leaves.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt or kosher salt.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
    
        <li>
            Bake the Pizza:
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or steel in the oven. You may use a pizza peel or a flat baking sheet for this.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 90 seconds to 2 minutes. The high temperature ensures a quick cooking time, creating the characteristic leopard-spotted crust.</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
    
        <li>
            Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Once the crust is puffed and charred, remove the pizza from the oven.</li>
                <li>Let it cool for a moment, then slice and serve immediately.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol><hr><br>
    <p>Remember that Neapolitan pizza is all about simplicity and high-quality ingredients, and it's meant to be enjoyed right out of the oven when it's at its best.</p>
